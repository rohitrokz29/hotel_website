# hotel_website
This is my first project on web development

In this project there is a short backend app.js which handles all opening and trnasfering of pages from home to about, manu, contact,and others.
I used basic HTML, CSS , Javascript in Front-end, and Express.Js in Back-end. 
I have not included node_modules due to greater size.

In this project I used hotel name as Hotel Paradise (it does not have any relation between real Hotel Paradise).
